# codequiz

This project is a short code quiz that tests your Javascript knowledge. After starting the quiz, a timer will start counting down to 0. The quiz will show your results after each question is answered. Answer correctly to earn points, but answer incorrectly and the quiz will penalize you by subtracting time from the clock.

When you've answered all the questions or the timer runs out of time, you will be prompted to enter your initials to save your score.
